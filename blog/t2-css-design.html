      Margins, Borders, and Padding are essential in formatting your website. Without these three commands all your texts, your boxes, and your links could get jumbled together into a mess of text and colors. No one would visit your website; it'd be barren. Forever.

      Keep your website clean by separating everything. Let's break each of them down:
    </p><br>
    <img src="http://www.w3schools.com/css/box-model.gif"/><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Borders are the defining lines that separate content between one and another. It falls between the margins and padding. This can be changed to anything from a solid line to a dashed line:</li><br>

      There are multiple different borders that can be applied.
      <br><br>
    See how the boxes are so close together though? Lets separate them using...<br><br>
      <li> Margins. These guys keep these boxes away from each other. It gives them a break so you can easily tell when one box is separate from another. This will allow you to move elements around and give everything some personal space, like so:</li><br>

    Now see how that text is super squished in that orange box? Lets give it some more...<br><br>
      <li>Padding. This will expand the orange box out a little bit so that the text can look comfortable wherever you place it. Check it out: </li><br>

      <br><br>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This is the best way for me to simplify the differences of margins, paddings, and borders. Hope this has been helpful!
