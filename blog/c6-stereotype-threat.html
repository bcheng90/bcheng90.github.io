      Stereotype Threat can almost be defined with just those two words. How do you identify yourself? Do you identify yourself with your race, your gender, or your socioeconomic status? At some point, we all identify with a group because it's what makes us who we are. We find some comfort in knowing our own identity. However, that same identity can result in under-performamce due to anxiety. This anxiety is driven through the stereotypes that are linked to our different identities.

      I have experienced this throughout my life. I've felt both a stereotype threat and a stereotype boost. My experience with stereotype boost came from my time in school, prior to college. I identify with my Asian background and that gave me the pressure of achieving higher grades and trying to be one of the above average students. It caused me to overperform to fill the role of what my stereotype entailed. While this was great for my academics, it took a toll on my mental health. That pressure always caused me stress and frustration whenever I didn't do as well as I had hoped. My experience with stereotype threat can also be linked to that same identity. Growing up in a prodominantely white community, I first noticed I was of a different background around 1st grade. Before then, it never occured to me that I looked different or that my culture was different. When I became more aware, this started to build anxiety whenever I wrote book reports, spoke English, or even when we played sports. It didn't help my situation that I was thrown into an ESL class even though my English wasn't truly falling behind. I found myself pausing mid-sentence to double-check what I would say and worrying whenever gym class came. As I got older, that threat started to become a regular feeling and it wasn't until college that I truly understood what I was feeling and how it affected me.

      I found the best solution to combat stereotype threat is to simply speak about it. It's relieving to speak with others and find the support you're looking for. More often than not, you'll be able to find people who are willing to help. If anyone may start to feel like this, it's important to recognize this feeling and speak to others about it. Once it's out there in the open, the threat almost diminishes.
