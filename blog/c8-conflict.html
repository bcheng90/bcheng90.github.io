      Life tends to have it's ups and downs. It shouldn't ever really be flat-lined. I've found that when you walk into a conflict, your best approach is not to ignore it; but to recognize it and analyze how you're feeling. It's important for me to be able to know what's going on within my head so that I can remain calm and not do or say something I'll regret.

      Back in the days when I had a job, (haha) I used to manage three other employees. One of my employees was a little bit of an odd-ball. I never thought of him lesser for that though. He was a great conversationalist and the topics he would teach me about kept me thinking. However, we did come into a conflict. Within my old position, I managed everything from how they train, to how they sell, to even how they dress. The dress code was lenient, business-casual but no tennis-shoes or sneakers. Easy to follow, no?
    </p>
    <p id="p">
      My employee, however, started to come into work wearing Vans sneakers. I was surprised at first, since he had been working with me for over eight months and he knew the rules. So I approached him and asked why he decided to come in wearing tennis shoes. He gave no answer. He only stayed silent. So, being his supervisor, I asked that he come in the next day with proper attire.

      The next day, he came in with the same shoes and so, I took him aside and told him the rules. I had him comply with dress code, meaning, I sent him home and back to get into what is expected of him for proper attire. He went home and came back with correct attire, and we continued working. After I had left for the day, I got a text message from him and I knew imemediately that my employee was not a happy camper.

    <p id="p">
      He sent, what would be considered, an "essay" through text. Calling me certain slurs and questioning my work ethic and my work performance. I was kind of shocked to receive this and I wasn't sure how to respond at first. I spent a good amount of time thinking about where this really stemmed from and I had to think about everything the past week of where this could've began.
    </p>
    <p id="p">
      This incident led me to realize that I may have missed certain small details of how he's been feeling the past week. There were small hints here and there that he was upset with another one of my employees but it never really came straight to my attention. It was small comments here and there throughout the day, and I knew that he didn't like the other employee as much. So once I figured it out, I called him to discuss why he messaged me his "essay". We talked about what was going on and how he was feeling the past week. That's when it came up that he hasn't been happy with the other employee and he didn't mean to blow up on me. He apologized for his actions the past week and that it wasn't the right way of conducting himself in a professional setting. The next day, I sat him down with the other employee and mediated. We needed to get past this as a team in order for our work to continue. They discussed their problems, we talked about possible solutions and we were able to solve any tensions that they had against each other.
    </p>

      If I could go back, I would've tried to catch the small details earlier. If I paid attention to them, this would have all been avoided and my superiors wouldn't have had to hear about it. I learned that no matter how small, it's important to make sure everyone feels valued. Some may lag behind, some may slack a little, but if they're all on the same team, we'll need to create an environment that pushes all of us forward. I hope that in the future I would be able to fix any possible conflicts early on.
