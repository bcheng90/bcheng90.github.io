      I'm sitting at my desk trying to figure out what values make up my life. It's hard to actually think about it when you try. These values make up your every day life, they are what sway your decisions, they are why we do what we do. Putting these values down onto paper (or on a blog) kind of makes me draw a blank. It's not that I don't know what I value; it's that I'm not sure I can fit everything I value into what I want to reveal.

      As I explore my values, I think back to the times that I've been the happiest, the proudest, etc. From there, I know what values come to mind. Accomplishment, confidence, efficiency, helping others, introspection, mindfulness, personal development, self-knowledge, stability, will-power. These are only some of the values that come to mind and it's difficult to rate them in order of importance. These values change with the situation. Let's explore one of them.

      Introspection is not something that you'll hear many people say as their most valued. Though, at times, it does seem to be for me. To reevaluate how you're doing both mentally and emotionally, is important. It leads to a much healthier brain and a much healthier body. <br>
      <i>"Mens sana in corpore sano"</i>-Roman poet <b>Juvenal</b><br>
      This is translated as "a sound mind in a sound body". It can be said that it is equally imporant to have a sound body in a sound mind. This quote, when I first read it, defined the life I want to lead. It taught me that physical and mental health should lay higher than all others as you can't expect to take care of others when you can't even take care of yourself. I explore my mind as often as I can. I try to see where I can improve and where I am doing well. It's important for me to understand where my head is at so I can continue to do what I do.

      The latest time I helped out a friend wasn't too long ago. This person, which we'll name "John" was stuck on the idea that spending more time in school wasn't really worth it for him anymore. "John" only has to spend a few more months and then it'll be time for the job search but he's a little antsy to get his feet wet in the real world. I spoke with him to ask him what were the pros of leaving school and jumping into the real world a few months early. We spoke and I realized that he didn't know what he was getting out of school. He felt no accomplishments, his confidence in his work hasn't gotten better throughout the years, and he just didn't see a point. This all related to his own personal development. As we spoke, we talked about how much he's done. We spoke about all the things he has accomplished and it helped us both realize that we can't stay comparing ourselves to others. It's important to look back and realize how far you've come in whatever time-frame. It was an eye opening talk for both him and me.

      When I think about all my values, it helps keep me in check of myself. It's a great way to remind myself what I want to be doing and what ways I can accomplish it. I think I'll always have the feeling of stereotype threat or imposter syndrome in the back of my head, however, keeping true to my values first will help mitigate that.
