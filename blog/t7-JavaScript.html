      I've spent three weeks getting attuned to Ruby and all the different concepts that are included within it. After going through that for so long, it felt like my brain only knew how to (barely) speak in Ruby and nothing else. This past week, we've delved into JavaScript and my brain is a mush now. It's been tough to switch between the two but thankfully, this week primarily dealt with JavaScript and Ruby was only used once. It's nice to see that the concepts I've learned from Ruby also are applied within JavaScript. I've been able to overlap them in some cases but I always have to watch myself becuase not everything is the same.

      Within Ruby, they have the ability to create hashes. These hashes have different keys (which could be integers or strings) and values (which could also be integers, strings, etc.). The keys are tied to the values and they can be accessed through different methods. There are ways to change the hash, create a hash within the hash, etc. This is one of Ruby's data structures. Within JavaScript, there exists a data structure that is similar to a hash, but holds different rules. JavaScript objects are data structures that are made up of properties. You can set these properties to the object and set many different properties to one object. Say you have an object in JavaScript, John. You can set different properties like "Name: 'John'", "Age: 24", or "Favorite food: Pizza". With Hashes in Ruby, you can only set one key to the value unless you create a multiple hashes to each key.

      All in all, Ruby and Javascript do differ. However, once you get a good hand on each, I believe it'll be much easier to switch between them.
