      My first site was all blue. Everything was blue.<br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/BXuUR.png" height="300"><br>
      So, I finally sat down and tried to figure out the best visually colorful palette I could. After establishing my "bumblebee" color scheme, I knew I had to switch up my borders as well. Finding inset/outset was probably the coolest. I didn't know there were other ways to get two-tone borders. I needed to try to figure out the darker shade of the border so I ended up using a site to extract the hex color so I could make my navigation bar match my box borders. I'm going to keep my main page going as bumblee schemed while my blogs are blue just incase I need to get back my old colors. If I truly end up using this color palette, I'll have to come back and switch my blog posts to match.

      After creating the CSS Positioning cheat sheet, I tried using it within my actually main site. It worked pretty well, I got my top bar to stay fixed at the top and my main content was positioned perfectly to be scrolled up and down. Now all I'm really missing is content. It was a fun experiement this time around, considering my CSS skills are much better than before. I still have some trouble envisioning what exactly my end site is going to be, but this is a good start.
