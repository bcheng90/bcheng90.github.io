      An important part of learning is understanding your own thinking style. After reviewing my Gregorc Thinking style, I've concluded that I am primarily a Concrete Random thinker with the secondary thinking style of Abstract Random. The concrete quality is related to the five senses. It is the direct approach to things. There are no hidden messages. It is in the "here and now". Abstract quality is related to seeing what is not there. To conceive ideas and to understand. It is the quality that is related to reading between the lines. Random ability represents your mind organizing information in chunks. There doesn't need to be an order to things like it does with sequential thinkers. Random thinkers are more spontaneous and impulsive.

      Within DBC, I've applied this thinking style to my learning. I've learned that I am more of a trials and error learner. If I get stuck, it's been tough to figure out what direction to go towards. I'll need to get more comfortable with taking bigger leaps and be comfortable with switching my approaches. I found that when I am working alone, I become more of a concrete random thinker but when I pair program, I am much more of an abstract random thinker.

      After grasping an understanding of how I think, the next step is to be open to learning. There are two mindsets of learning. One is fixed; the other, growth. A fixed mindset of learning believes that intelligence can't be increased. It's what you're born with and that's all. A person with a fixed mindset tends to avoid challenges, give up easily, and ignore feedback. A growth mindset believes you can continue becoming more intelligent and you can continuously grow by pursuing knowledge. They embrace challenges and learn from criticism.

      I try to keep the growth mindset during my learning. I've found that during the past few weeks of Phase 0, I've mostly been able to stay optimistic within my learning. It's tough when there are times that I unknowingly set mental roadblocks. I become a little frustrated but when I do, I take a short break. Ideally, it'd be best if I can stop myself from becoming flustered with the material, but it's a learning process! The growth mindset allows me to not limit myself and I'll need to continue to grow to be more comfortable with where I'm at.
