      It's important to recognize that there are no industries without their own problems. Technology is no different. Within the technology industry, one of the most prominent problems it faces is the bleak representation of women and the culture that doesn't openly accept them.

      To say that the problem is a pipeline problem is to feign ignorance. It's easy to blame it on the fact that there aren't enough women who study math or science. However, the real problem lies within the culture. There are generally no maternity leave offered by companies and there are many environments where women are found to be discriminated against. The culture of "brogrammers" and not allowing women to "fit" within the technology industry needs to change.

      The solution is tough. It won't be easy to change a culture unless there's a new overhaul of attitude. It begins with the new age of programmers and the new tech companies. Once the environment is built to accept everyone, it'll begin to change the older ways. To fix the problem of maternity leave, it's important to be mindful of what is going on around us. Even the Department of Labor recognizes this problem and recently addressed it within a video. See <a href="http://www.dol.gov/featured/paidleave/">here</a> for the video!
