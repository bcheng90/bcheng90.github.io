      Almost finished with the first week of Phase 0 in DBC and it's been a trip! I am behind a little bit but surprisingly, I'm picking up the material pretty well. I'm learning a lot about the very beginnings of programming. I have to admit, it's a little overwhelming though. It's a lot of information and we haven't even gone into learning a language! I'll be using this blog to record my progress within the next coming weeks.

       This week we've learned all about the Command Line, how to use Terminal, and how to use Sublime. The whole system of creating code can get pretty crazy but knowing that you have a safety net is amazing. This is where "Version Control" comes in. Version control allows a user or multiple users to make multiple different files that stem from the main file. Any progress that a user makes within their own file will not affect the main. It's a great way to prevent users from stepping on each other's toes. You'll work on your's; they'll work on their's; and ultimately, the files that everyone creates can be merged together into one central file. If you find that the file doesn't work, you can go back to different versions and see where it all went wrong!

      Since we spoke about version control, it's important to talk about git. Git is a type of VC that we'll be using at DBC and for tracking our changes within our computer. Any changes to my code will be made using git, which stays locally (meaning it's not out there for the world, it's for my eyes only). A cool way to understand git is to think of it like this (thank you, Internet): You're living in your own universe. Next, you take everything from your universe and you start creating parallel universes with different situations and outcomes. From there, once you create the best version of those universes, you merge it into your current one. BAM. How's your head doing right now? Mine too. Now within git, every time you save your progress, you must commit it. A commit is kind of like a save point that you'd find within a video game. Every time you commit something, you'll have the option of adding a small message, which can be helpful to keep track of what you did every time you commit your changes.

      To publicize all of our progress, we'll be using GitHub! It's kind of like a coder's facebook. It's a social media website built upon sharing your code within communities. Multiple users can view your public code and they may even edit it or improve it. Your code is out in the open for everyone to help. Another way to use GitHub is to think of it as a Dropbox. It's your portable flashdrive that follows you everywhere. You no longer need to worry about having your computer all the time since you'll be able to just log into GitHub and view it all there!

      That's all I got for this week! Thanks for reading!
