      Pair programming has become essential within the weeks of DBC. Pairing with others to solve challenges is quite fun! It's a great way to both reinforce what I've learned throughout the week, as well as, giving me another perspective on how to solve them. Working with all different students within the cohort has been really enjoyable and a great learning experience. I've received so much help in getting to understand the logic of coding and it's awesome to have another mind to help check that I'm working in the right direction. It doesn't always go super smoothly, especially if we both get stuck on a challenge and it's just silent. Breaks are helpful, but it's not always solved by taking a five minute break. I get frustrated with myself when I'm stuck on it and I feel bad because I start thinking that I'm holding my pair back. However, when I do catch myself getting frustrated, I take a step back and realize that we're both learning this and we're both struggling! We eventually solve the challenges, though sometimes it's much longer sessions than we had planned. In the end, it's really great to see how much we grow each week, even with all the times we get errors and all, haha.

      Feedback is another essential part of DBC. This is where you get tips on how to become a more effective programmer. Students leave anonymous feedback for each other after every pairing session. The received feedback helps me understand where I need more work and where I'm doing well. It's coupled with the feedback given after a guided pairing session, which is when a guide pops into a pairing session with another student and the guide will pop in here and there to direct us in the right way. I really like the way it's set up so that even your own feedback that you give to others is rated. It tells you if it's specific, actionable, and kind. This type of system builds a much greater culture and helps me understand what it means to be a good programmer.
