      What exactly makes a good question? I tend to ask a bunch whenever I don't understand something, but I've found that not all of my own questions are that concise. They build from one to the other until I can grasp whatever concept I didn't understand. After researching what makes a good question, I believe it's important to be able to ask all that you want to know within one question. The construction of it must be specific and efficient. The way I ask questions tend to promote more conversation, however, it leads to building a massive pryamid of all different questions that may or may not be what I was originally looking for.

      The greatest take-away from the readings is ultimately to think in terms of the reader. It's important to put yourself in the shoes of someone looking to answer your question. If it's readible, has enough context, and has examples of the code being questioned, it should give them enough information to figure out what needs to be done to get it working. After reviewing one of my questions to my accountability group, I can safely say... my questions need work, haha. I had asked my accountability group for help on my solo challenge after it was due. I wasn't able to get my horizontal and vertical checkers to work out because it kept returning that I had one, even if the five X's were not in the same row or column. I had tried to fix it for a while but it wasn't returning correctly. Now, my problem with my question is that I didn't actually ask anything other than "help me!". I was able to give them a portion of my solution, I also gave them background on what happens when I try to run the tests so they can replicate it. However, my biggest problem was that I wasn't sure where exactly it was going wrong so I had no specific question to ask. What I could have done better is go back to my code and check each part until I could figure out where the logic wasn't working correctly so that I could further pinpoint it for them to help me. Luckily, one of my group members understood what I was looking for and was able to point me in the right direction. With one simple sentence of guidance, I was able to go back to my code and see where exactly I went wrong.

      These next 9 weeks are going to be filled with questions and confusion. I'm both excited and nervous for it. However, I'm also hopeful that I'll be able to ask great questions in the coming weeks. Wish me luck!
