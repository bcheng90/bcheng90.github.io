      Let's begin from how I found Dev Bootcamp. My friend, who's studying computer science, always used to tell me about his classes and what's been tough or challenging within them. Coding came up whenever I met up with him because his life was absorbed by his major. When I told him I was thinking about learning how to code, he was excited to give me a recipe to get started. He suggested I start small and work with a website to learn how to code for free. Once my interest picked up, we spoke about possibly going for a bootcamp, rather than going back to school. It was great to have the support of a friend and it was awesome on his part to not spoon-feed me everything.

      From this point, I did my research and I found a ton of different schools. Some were for well seasoned coders and some were for beginners. Some were quite shady and some were not. But what I found was that unlike nearly all of the schools out there, Dev Bootcamp wasn't simply teachiing you how to write code. They were teaching you a lifestyle. It wasn't just hours of sitting in a chair and coding to them. Their program promoted the culture of programming and how to keep a balance in your life.

      This is what I was looking for. I want the experience of learning how to program but I don't want to sacrifice my journey of growing as person. DBC was built for that reason. They're looking to teach all aspects of life, but with a concentration on becoming a programmer.

      I'm immensely excited to throw myself into this different learning environment and I'm immensely nervous to see where this will take me. Shereef spoke about the fears people have going into Phase 1 and I can definitely relate. Nearly everyone will experience these fears but just make sure you keep pushing yourself past it! Life is all about learning! Stay hungry!
